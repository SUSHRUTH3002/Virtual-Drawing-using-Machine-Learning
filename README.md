# Virtual Drawing using Machine Learning

A computer vision-based virtual drawing application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures. The application uses MediaPipe for hand detection and OpenCV for real-time video processing and drawing operations.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection with 21 hand landmarks
- **Multiple Drawing Tools**: 
  - Freehand drawing
  - Line drawing
  - Rectangle drawing
  - Circle drawing
  - Eraser tool
- **Gesture-based Tool Selection**: Select tools by hovering over tool icons with timer-based confirmation
- **Air Drawing**: Draw in the air using index finger movements with gesture recognition
- **Real-time Preview**: See drawing shapes before finalizing them
- **Scalable Window Size**: Configurable window dimensions from 640x480 to 1280x720 or larger
- **Smart Coordinate Scaling**: Automatic scaling between camera resolution and display resolution

## Running the Application

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

### Using the Application

1. **Start the Application**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Position Your Hand**: Hold your hand in front of the camera (arm's length distance)
3. **Select Tools**: 
   - Hover your index finger over the tool selection area (top-left)
   - Wait for the yellow circle to shrink completely (0.8 seconds) to select a tool
   - Current tool name will be displayed on screen
4. **Draw**: 
   - Raise your index finger (keep middle finger down) to start drawing
   - Move your index finger to draw
   - Lower your index finger to stop drawing
5. **Preview Mode**: For shapes (line, rectangle, circle), see real-time preview before finalizing
6. **Exit**: Press the ESC key to close the application

### Available Tools

- **Line**: Draw straight lines between two points
- **Rectangle**: Draw rectangles by defining corners
- **Draw**: Freehand drawing with continuous lines
- **Circle**: Draw circles by defining center and radius
- **Erase**: Erase drawings with circular eraser tool

### Gesture Controls

- **Index Finger Up + Middle Finger Down**: Drawing/Active mode
- **Index Finger Down**: Stop drawing/Inactive mode
- **Hover in Tool Area**: Tool selection mode (with timer)

## Configuration

The application can be customized by modifying `config/settings.py`:

### Display Settings
```python
WINDOW_WIDTH = 640          # Camera feed width
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 480         # Camera feed height
```

### Hand Detection Settings
```python
MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE = 0.6    # Minimum confidence for hand detection (0.1-1.0)
MIN_TRACKING_CONFIDENCE = 0.6     # Minimum confidence for hand tracking (0.1-1.0)
MAX_NUM_HANDS = 1                  # Maximum number of hands to detect
```

### Drawing Settings
```python
DEFAULT_THICKNESS = 4              # Default drawing line thickness
SELECTION_TIME_THRESHOLD = 0.8     # Time to hold for tool selection (seconds)
INDEX_FINGER_THRESHOLD = 40        # Sensitivity for finger gesture detection
ERASER_RADIUS = 30                 # Eraser tool radius
SELECTION_RADIUS = 50              # Tool selection indicator radius
```

### Color Customization
```python
COLORS = {
    "selection_circle": (0, 255, 255),    # Yellow selection indicator
    "line_preview": (50, 152, 255),       # Orange line preview
    "rectangle_preview": (0, 255, 255),   # Yellow rectangle preview
    "circle_preview": (255, 255, 0),      # Cyan circle preview
    "text": (0, 0, 255),                  # Red text
    "eraser": (0, 0, 0)                   # Black eraser
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenCV Dimension Error**
   ```
   Error: (-215:Assertion failed) (mtype == CV_8U || mtype == CV_8S) && _mask.sameSize(*psrc1)
   ```
   - **Solution**: Ensure `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT` match your camera's actual resolution or enable proper scaling
   - Check that mask dimensions match frame dimensions

2. **MediaPipe Warning**
   ```
   Using NORM_RECT without IMAGE_DIMENSIONS is only supported for the square ROI
   ```
   - **Solution**: This is a warning and doesn't affect functionality. Ensure camera is properly initialized

3. **Camera Not Working**
   - Ensure your camera is not being used by another application
   - Try changing the camera index: `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` instead of `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`
   - Check camera permissions in system settings

4. **Hand Detection Not Working**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions (avoid backlighting)
   - Keep your hand clearly visible in the camera frame
   - Maintain distance of 1-3 feet from camera
   - Adjust `MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE` (try 0.5 for better detection)

5. **Tool Selection Not Responsive**
   - Ensure you're hovering over the correct tool area (top-left corner)
   - Wait for the full selection time (default 0.8 seconds)
   - Check if your hand is properly detected (landmarks should be visible)
   - Try adjusting `SELECTION_TIME_THRESHOLD` to 0.5 for faster selection

6. **Drawing Not Working**
   - Make sure you're raising your index finger while keeping other fingers down
   - Adjust `INDEX_FINGER_THRESHOLD` (try 30 for more sensitivity, 50 for less)
   - Ensure proper lighting and hand visibility

7. **Window Too Small/Large**
   - Modify `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT` in `config/settings.py`
   - Common resolutions: 640x480, 1280x720, 1920x1080
   - Ensure your display supports the chosen resolution

### Performance Optimization

- Close other applications using the camera
- Ensure good lighting for better hand detection
- Use a dedicated GPU if available for better performance
- Lower `MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE` slightly if detection is slow
- Reduce window size if experiencing lag

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `config/settings.py`:
```python
DEBUG_MODE = True
PRINT_DIMENSIONS = True
```

This will print frame and mask dimensions to help troubleshoot dimension mismatch issues.
